## My process

Created two divs and placed them in the body. The first div is used for the heading and the second for the content. I then used use CSS drid to arrange the content box the correct position.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a new way to use CSS grid and got a better understanding of the positioning properties.

### Continued development

This challenge made a joke of me. I learnt I still have a long way to go in styling with CSS especially using the flex box and grid properties. I'm going to put more effort into those aspects.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Claude AI and ChatGPT for helping me better some concepts in CSS. I used them a lot when I get confused on how to go about some of the things in html and css and their implementation.
